1. Go to notepad and create one file as BatteryFull.txt

2. Then add below code there as written inside this file.


set oLocator = CreateObject("WbemScripting.SWbemLocator")
set oServices = oLocator.ConnectServer(".","root\wmi")
set oResults = oServices.ExecQuery("select * from batteryfullchargedcapacity")
for each oResult in oResults
   iFull = oResult.FullChargedCapacity
next

while (1)
  set oResults = oServices.ExecQuery("select * from batterystatus")
  for each oResult in oResults
    iRemaining = oResult.RemainingCapacity
    bCharging = oResult.Charging
  next
  iPercent = ((iRemaining / iFull) * 100) mod 100
  if bCharging and (iPercent > 98) Then msgbox "Battery is fully charged"
  wscript.sleep 30000 ' 5 minutes
wend


3. Then save as this file as Batteryfull.vbs  ---> make sure filele extension is .vbs important.
